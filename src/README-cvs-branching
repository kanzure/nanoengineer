CVS branching is sometimes usefully done with small subsets of a
source tree. In that case, you would change the branch file to be
a list of the files specific to your branch, like this:

----- 8< -----
VQT.py
jigs_motors.py
whatsthis.py
----- 8< -----

When you want to check out your branch, you first check out the
entire tree, then check out your branch on top of it:

cvs co cad
cd cad/src
cvs up -r wware_mybranch_20051228 branch
cvs up -r wware_mybranch_20051228 `cat branch`

When you've done some work in your branch and you want to commit
it, use this command:

cvs commit -r wware_mybranch_20051228 `cat branch`

and if the contents of the branch files changes (you need
to branch more files, or fewer, or different ones), then:

cvs commit -r wware_mybranch_20051228 branch

==

If you want to make a new branch containing only new files (such as
debugging code, perhaps never intended to become part of the main branch),
you have to first introduce your new branch tag onto an existing file, which
might as well be 'branch':

cvs tag -b bruce_debug_branch_060315 branch

Then you can edit 'branch' to contain the list of new files meant for your
new branch, and commit it. 

echo my_debug_code.py > branch
cvs commit -r bruce_debug_branch_060315 -m "new branch for debugging" branch

When using 'cvs add' on the new files meant for your branch, you don't use
any option or mention the branch, but you use -r when you commit it:

cvs add my_debug_code.py

cvs commit -r bruce_debug_branch_060315 -m "debugging code in my branch" my_debug_code.py

[Maybe Will can edit this to say whether, after this, the branch tag on the
files branch and my_debug_code.py will be 'sticky', and if so (or if not)
what you should do and watch out for, especially if you are using the branch
files in the same checkout directory in which you do most of your work in
the MAIN branch.]
