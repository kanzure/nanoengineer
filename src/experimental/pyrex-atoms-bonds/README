The idea is to create Pyrex base classes for atoms, bonds, and atom
sets that make some operations much more efficient, primarily graphics
operations and undo/redo operations. An additional benefit is that we
can start to define atoms, bonds and atom sets in a way that isn't
dependent upon Qt or OpenGL or other GUI-related stuff, so that
somebody can import them into a Python script without having all the
GUI stuff installed. This should not conflict with formulating them in
a way that makes graphics operations efficient. With a little luck we
will find that they are efficient with different kinds of graphics
systems (e.g. Gtk, WxWindows).

======================

Will, FYI,

(The following are all just ideas for discussion or to think about:)

If you want to make realistic AtomBase objects in Python as a
prototype for what can be later made in Pyrex, with our existing class
Atom inheriting from it, and a lot of the Atom Python methods not
having to be rewritten, then in order to make this work smoothly, we
might want most of the AtomBase attributes to be a bit different from
the Atom attributes they relate to.

For example, Atoms have .element, an Elem or Element object (I forget
the name), but AtomBase might prefer to have a small int which is the
atomic number, say ._eltnum, (0 for singlet, same as some attribute of
the existing .element object, maybe .eltnum), and then we'd make
.element look up the Elem object from a table. But things like Undo
(and mmp binary save methods) would treat the ._eltnum as the primary
data, and its type being small int (or char or whatever) would make
that more convenient, especially for fitting it into arrays.

And a more important case is for the hybridization. Right now, Atom
has .atomtype which is a Python object encoding both the element and
its hybridization (thus partly redundant with .element), and knowing a
lot about that combination. But, one of the legal states for .atomtype
which we need to support is "unset" (i.e. getattr(Atom, 'atomtype')
would raise an AttributeError exception then), since Atom has a
__getattr__ method which notices that and computes a best-guess
.atomtype in a nontrivial way from the current .element and number of
bonds (etc). So there is nothing you can set .atomtype to (in
high-level Python) which is equivalent to having it be unset.

So for AtomBase we might want another small int, either ._atomtype or
._hybridization depending on whether we want it to also imply the
._element like we do in the high-level case. Then we'd say that
._hybridization == 0 means .atomtype is unset, and ._hybridization in
[1,2,3] means .atomtype is set to the sp, sp2, or sp3 form of
.element, respectively. And Undo, Save, etc, would only save arrays or
dicts of ._hybridization, which could be compressed even more (2 or 3
bits each -- maybe 3 since there's one other hybridization we support
so far, sp2g, or sp2(graphitic), and maybe more in the future).
