What was new in NanoEngineer-1 v0.0.6 (8/17/2005):

1. Atomic hybridization and higher order bond types:
  - Support for the following atomic hybrid orbitals:
     - Carbon: sp3, sp2, sp
     - Nitrogen: sp3, sp2, sp, graphitic
     - Oxygen: sp3, sp2
     - Sulfur: sp3, sp2
     - Hydrogen: s
  - Support for the following bond types:
     - single
     - double
     - triple
     - aromatic
     - graphitic
     - carbomeric*

* carbomeric bonds are an order-2.5 bond, sometimes used in carbomers. Alpha 6 
supports drawing and valence checking of carbomeric bonds, but they are 
simulated and stored in the mmp file as aromatic bonds.  This means carbomeric
bonds can't be stored and reloaded from a mmp file, which is a known bug we'll
fix for Alpha 7.

2. Build Mode:
  - New Molecular Modeling Kit (MMKit) used for selecting elements and 
    atomic hybridizations
  - Bonds are selectable and can be deleted using CTRL+ Left-click (or 
    CMD + Left-click on MacOS X)
  - Bonds can be changed using new sub-modes on the dashboard
  - Clipboard integration with the MMKit for copying and pasting molecules
  - Keyboard accelerators for element and atomic hybridization selections

3. Select Atoms Mode:
  - Support for copying/pasting selected atoms
  - Improved dashboard for selecting (and transmuting) atoms
  - Selection Filter now works for Select Connected and Select Doubly
  - Select Connected and Select Doubly have been added to the dashboard
  - Select Doubly much faster

4. New GAMESS client interface:
  - Energy calculations
  - Optimizations
  - Supports PC GAMESS on Windows
  - Supports GAMESS-US on Linux/MacOSX

5. Jigs:
  - Selection of Jigs in the 3D workspace (graphic area)
  - Copying and pasting of jigs (together with their chunk/atoms)
  - New model tree context menu item to select all atoms of any Jig or set 
    of Jigs
  - New model tree context menu item to disable/enable Jigs, which determines
    whether the Jig is used during a simulation
  - New model tree context menu item for Rotary/Linear Motors "Align to Chunk",
    which relaigns the motor
    to the first chunk it is attached to
  - New model tree context menu item for Rotary/Linear Motors "Recenter on 
    Atoms", which recenters the motor to the atoms it is attached to

6. Molecular Dynamics Simulator:
  - Revised Simulator Setup dialog
  - Support for Linear motor
  - Jigs can be disabled (and enabled) in the model tree via their context menu
  - MD supported for atomic hybridizations and higher order bonds (see list 
    above) with the following exceptions:
     - Still no torsion; this will make systems with double or 
       aromatic/graphitic bonds act less stiff than they really should.  
       The parameters for aromatic and graphitic bonds are interpolated rather
       than measured directly
     - The simulator does not handle hydrogen bonds or dative bonds
     - The parameters for stretches with fluorine and bends with boron or 
       a double bond to nitrogen are estimated rather than computed
     - The whole set may need an overall correction factor of some kind. The 
       main variable, absolute energy numbers from Gamess, is self canceling 
       since we're only using relative energies, and we used the same level 
       of theory for all the runs. Still there may be some systematic 
       correction that is needed
     - A more sophisticated fitting procedure, and support for electrostatics,
       is in the works for Alpha 7

7. New Preferences dialog (Edit > Preferences):
  - atom highlight color
  - free valence color
  - free valence hotspot color
  - bond highlight color
  - bond vanes/ribbons color
  - bond stretch color
  - CPK cylinder color
  - higher order bond display modes: multiple cylinders, vanes, or ribbons
  - show valence erros on/off
  - turn on/off bond letters for double, triple, aromatic and graphitic bonds
  - background color (solid or gradient)
  - compass location
  - compass on/off
  - origin axis on/off
  - point of view axis on/off

8. Move Chunks:
  - New dashboard dropbox includes the following options:
     - Translate
     - Rotate X (by specified angle "Theta")
     - Rotate Y (by specified angle "Theta")
     - Rotate Z (by specified angle "Theta")

9. Movie Player:
  - Significant speed improvement
  - Circular arrow on end of rotary motor shaft rotates with motor
  - New "POV-Ray Series" save option that allows the user to dump the current
    movie as a series of .pov files (which can then be povrayed by the user
    and collected into an mpeg offline)

10. Model Tree:
  - New model tree context menu item "Delete all clipboard items"
  - New model tree context menu item "Create new empty clipboard item"

11. Opposite View:
  - New command (View > Opposite View) that flips the current view to the
    opposite side

12. Align to Common Axis:
  - Now aligns selected chunks to the first selected chunk's axis (instead
    of the average axis of all selected chunks)

    when reopening the part.
19. Jigs:
  - Jigs can be disabled using the Model Tree context menu, or by
    dragging them to the Clipboard; disabled jigs remain attached to the
    same atoms, even when saved to and reloaded from an MMP file, but have
    no effect on the simulator until they are re-enabled.
  - Jigs can be located anywhere in the Model Tree, and this location is
    not altered when saving the MMP file.
