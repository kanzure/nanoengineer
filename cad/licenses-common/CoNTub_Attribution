Nanorex has modified the CoNTub source code, originally written by S. Melchor
and J. Dobado at the Universidad de Granada in Spain. Citations of this work,
including journal publication of structures generated with the CoNTub
algorithm, should be formatted as follows:

  "CoNTub: an algorithm for connecting two arbitrary carbon
  nanotubes." S. Melchor; J.A. Dobado. Journal of Chemical Information
  and Computer Sciences, 44, 1639-1646 (2004)

Nanorex's modifications include translation from Java to C++, performance
improvement in bond inference, changing the output file format from pdb to mmp,
and revising the stderr messages and exit code.
