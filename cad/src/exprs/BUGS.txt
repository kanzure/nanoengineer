This is a place to record bugs in the exprs module that need to not be
forgotten, and have no better place to be recorded at this time (the use of
bugzilla being premature at this early stage of its development).

Most bugs are apparent enough that the best place to discuss how to fix them
is next to the code that will have to be fixed, in a comment or in a
"printnim" call.

But for a few, it's hard to know where to record them, or they might be
forgotten there, so they're listed here, in order of addition to this file.

When they get fully fixed, and after a few days are thought to be
permanently fixed, they can be moved from this file into BUGS-fixed.txt.
If they are just worked around but need better fixes later, they should
remain in this file (if code comments are not enough).

061208 texture dims not always a power of 2 (from a couple weeks ago)

I rely on OpenGL handling textures of arbitrary
sizes, even though some OpenGL drivers or chips require their dimensions to be
powers of 2. Before release, we should add code to ask OpenGL whether it can handle this,
and work around it if not.

061208 Fix the jig select code in modes files as described here:

    # self.current_glselect - FIX UNLESS LOCAL - seems ok since local -- WRONG, external code looks at it! (modes, selectMode)
        # btw, the same code in those files fails to set it here... in fact maybe i'm wrong and it doesn't look at it,
        # but starting now [061208 1032p] Highlightable is going to look at it, so (1) i'll put it in self.delegate,
        # (2) the jig select code in those files might be wrong now, if I ever draw jigs in funny projection matrices
        # (as I surely will someday).

[maybe NAB] 061210 usage-tracking of glpane attrs width, height, zoomFactor, scale

Calls to gluProject, gluUnProject (eg via mousepoints) get results which depend on those variables, but don't usage-track them.
We can ignore this in terms of knowing about global redraw (since changes to those would trigger it), but not
for knowing when to invalidate display lists. OTOH, maybe those funcs can't be run inside them? I'm not sure.

More generally, I'm not sure whether we need usage-tracking of glpane height & width for related things like DrawInCorner.

061211 testmode model viewpoint seems wrong

how come testmode shows the model (with atoms, in assy) in a different viewpoint than
Build mode does?

I suspect it translates before drawing it. But I can't find any code that would do that!

update 061218: I recently (a few days ago?) saw some glTranslates in testdraw that might do that,
and added prefs to not run that code (or other related code), and checkboxes in lower left
corner to control those, so maybe this fixed it (when those checkboxes are off), but I
didn't test that yet. ... Now I did; it's not fixed. 

But I have another theory: it might just be due to the larger glpane in testmode as opposed
to Build mode, due to fewer toolbars being visible when in testmode. ####k should test that,
perhaps by making a debug pref for whether or not to remove the toolbars in testmode.

==

[fixed] 061218 when highlighting the fake openclose icons in e.g. testexpr_10c,
only the gray rect is seen, not the + or - text. I first noticed this just after fixing the
previous bug, so that fix may have caused it, but I don't often try to highlight those icons,
so that fix having caused it is not proven.

(Speculation: this might be an effect of the roundoff issue mentioned at the end of that bug
discussion, above.)

update 061219: more likely, it's just that Overlay scan order is backwards, 
appropriate for GL_LESS but not for GL_LEQUAL, and the buggy fake icon makes use of an Overlay
of gray rect and text. Fixable by reversing Overlay order in this case, or switching
to GL_LEQUAL all the time (or all the time in testmode, provided these things are not
drawn in other modes, but since model objs are drawn there, that makes no sense except
as a temporary situation). 

update 070105: Here is a specific better way of doing the above fix:

plan: new glpane var, set up in init_glpane_vars, default_glDepthFunc,
normally one thing for NE1 and same for me, but have debug pref to make it normally the other;
and then change it in highlightable
to optim the nonuse of gldepthfunc
so when pref is set i never call it except when entering and leaving mode

also let this glpane var determine overlay order
(even tho it's only the default not the current)

then i predict my openicon hlighlight bug (that hides the plus sign) goes away and no other bugs come

no need yet to avoid descend into displists in highlighting, which in any case i don't want to do --
rather when HL has those decorators on draw, they should avoid displists only if some elements of them
should not be descended into -- once they reach level of draw it all, they should use them
(a dynamic flag seen by decorator will no longer say "be careful what you draw").

fixed 070117 by implementing a plan similar to the above, in GLPane, testmode, Highlightable, Overlay.
The fix details are not fully internally tested, but it does fix the reported bug.

There are two tested variants of the fix -- both work. In one, which is left in place in
the current code (near start of testmode.py, by setting standard_glDepthFunc to a nonstandard value),
glDepthFunc is always GL_LEQUAL when we're in testmode. This is simplest and probably best.
It won't fix the same bug in other modes of NE1 (if Overlay exprs would be displayed in them someday)
until we make the same change in other modes or in GLPane's default.

In the other bugfix-variant, glDepthFunc varies depending on whether we're in draw_in_abs_coords
(i.e. drawing highlights). This is predicted to have problems with display lists in current code, 
if the same one is used for highlight and normal drawing (evidently not the case in testexpr_10c
openclose icons, or the bug would not be fixed then -- an inference). That could be fixed by
compiling variant displists in those cases, which we'll need for other reasons and other GL state
someday, but it's not worth the trouble for this one compared to the "always GL_LEQUAL" bugfix-variant.

==

070106 when you draw one instance twice, Highlightables only work within the last-drawn copy,
since Highlightable only stores one draw-coord and draws one highlight-image.

It would not be too hard to make it store a series and redraw them all. But it might be better
to make these two instances get an env with different "highlighting state" -- except then they're
not really the same instance, are they? (Since .env is a function of instance.)

Either way, then we could implement stereo this way!

(My guess is, one instance recording >1 highlight pos is more efficient, as well as simpler,
than making two instances which share some stateplaces and not others. It's done for every
highlightable in the model, so you don't want the increased RAM to be larger than necessary.)

(The syntax for drawing one instance twice is also klugy and may stop working -- see testexpr_26
and its comments. But that's not this bug.)

070109 highlight update bug: in code like this (from demo_drag.py), 
the highlighted form doesn't get updated soon enough after it changes when the button is pressed,
as mentioned in the comment at the end:

If_kluge( getattr_Expr( world, '_cmd_Clear_nontrivial'),
          ActionButton( world._cmd_Clear, "button: clear"),
          ActionButton( world._cmd_Clear, "button (disabled): clear", enabled = False)
 ) 
 # works, though text change is so slow I suspect there's actually a highlighting or update bug 
 # making it appear even slower...
 # update 070109: the bug seems to be that as long as the mouse stays on the button, 
 # it remains highlighted with the old highlight form.

Theory: an old instance is stored in selobj/stencilbuffer and is being redrawn in abs coords,
and seems still selected even though a new instance has replaced it. But (1) I didn't confirm
it's a different instance, (2) even if it is, I'm not sure why already-coded checks are not
enough... but maybe the idea of an object not drawn in a frame becoming invalid as selobj
is still nim?? Not sure, but I bet it is, since I can't recall any record of whether an obj
does get drawn in a frame or not. (Just set a "last drawn in this frame" ivar in draw...) ####k

[worked around in demo_drag.py:]

070115 "highlightable-finder can be fooled due to _check_target_depth_fudge_factor of 0.0001"

[in earlier commits today, I misnamed this bug based on an incorrect theory of its cause:
070115 "DisplayListChunk breaks highlighting of testexpr_19f old nodes"]

[I'll remove these debugging notes sometime after this commit, and leave only the correct parts:]

in testexpr_19f:

drag of old nodes seems broken. is this is new or old bug?
I dimly remember hacking on the related code in demo_drag...
am I using _19f which is revised somehow? yes but it's old -- the improved clear button.

bug also appears in $B (doesn't have my lmods "revised stub types & type coercion, canon_type")

trying again carefully in $W, I note:

- disabling the debug pref for glpane skipping of Qt-redraws does not fix it; 
  further tests done while leaving it disabled (more redraws than usual for me, normal for NE1)
  (so this debug pref being False might be partially fixing this bug in the following tests,
   for all i know)

- the mouse over the little black rect reports same sbar msg (no change in sbar as I mouseover --
  indicating a bug in highlighting the rect) but does a new redraw per mousemotion
  (as if it's drawn in front but not drawn with a glname)

- tilt in XZ -- now old node is shown tilted (and draggable? not sure)
  but now I can't even make a new node (due to highlight/displist bug?)

- remake main instance, now i can make a new node, and can drag an old node

  (so I wonder if this is caused by the highlighting bug related to DisplayListChunk -- try disabling all those ###)
  
  and the old node is no longer tilted -- i think that indicates some sort of displist update bug!
  either that, or it's a bug in the drawing code that it implicitly uses the to-screen direction...
  or maybe it's related to snapshotting the look-expr for the node when making it... not sure ###

trying disabling displists: fixes all reported bugsI tried (all 3 rects are draggable
and affect sbar on mouseover, some just made and some from before remake main instance,
both before and after untilting using "home view")

conclusion: guess: bug is either in displist updating, or interaction of displist and highlight.
I'll add comments to DisplayListChunk and Highlightable mentioning this bug.

WRONG -- not so simple: trying it more, even with that debug_pref disabled, it is intermittent --
it might depend on how long I leave the mouse down when I make the node, or whether I move it over
the node at that time, or on which files were modified and presumably got reloaded w/o main instance
being remade (since this was changing over time as I did a commit).

Trying it again in a fresh session, I get an exception:
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'node_expr' referenced before assignment
  [selectMode.py:2294] [Highlightable.py:552] [Highlightable.py:649] [demo_drag.py:513]

I was wondering about that bug just before since I glanced it in the code,
but then couldn't see it when I read it more carefully 
(node_expr assignment is in else of 'if not self.use_VertexView', so doesn't happen;
 use is in else of 'if 0', so does happen). No idea why it was working before.
Not sure if it can relate to this bug, anyway. 

Fix that, try again in fresh session:

I still get the bug, and this time, no big chance DisplayListChunk or file reload could be involved.
WAIT, my debug_pref to disable DisplayListChunk is not persistent! So maybe it's still causing this.
Turning it off & remaking instance, bug can still happen on new nodes. I'll need to make that debug_pref
persistent and test again more carefully. ### TRY THAT LATER [I did]

... now I think the bug is caused by the 0.0001 being too large in check_target_depth in GLPane
compared to the DZ * PIXELS * 1 or 2 in different places in demo_drag.py.
Replacing them all with PIXELS * 3... this seems to have fixed it, even if I change all
debug_prefs back to defaults (enable displists, skip redraws only wanted by Qt).
But if I zoom out a bit, bug is predicted back... can't test that with displists enabled... 
not tested this time.

A better fix would be to change the 0.0001 in check_target_depth (see code comments for problems
to solve first); for now I made it depend on mode, but made testmode set it to existing value.
(I bet the old code needed 0.0001 to be so large due to cylinder or sphere
drawing misalignment -- if I fixed that, maybe it could tolerate a smaller threshhold.)

And the DZ * DZFUZZ (3 * PIXELS) in demo_drag.py could be replaced by a depth offset which
doesn't depend on zoom history, so mousewheel would not affect its size in depth
(i.e. not a value in model coords like now). Note that for use in displists, 
this has to be a direct depth offset, not a model coord change calculated to imitate
a desired depth offset using glu*Project.

WARNING: It's possible that the value of DZFUZZ needed to work around this bug depends
on the GLPane size, or on user prefs settings, or on Ortho vs Perspective! (all speculations)

070117 highlight failure if I mousewheel-zoom (in or out), 
then mouseover the label or button of a checkbox_pref in the corner

failure details: no highlight sbar_text, no action on press, debug_pref print like
;;debug_pref: preDraw_glselect_dict failure: targetdepth is 0.0099999317899346352, items are [(2, <Highlightable#16016(i)>)]

happens with the "drag new nodes?" checkbox_pref in testexpr_19f in bottom_right_corner]
seems repeatable -- in one session tried so far

070203

This is not a known bug, just an implem issue to think through to avoid likely bugs:
what happens to usage tracking while a command decides what to do, eg what expr to make?
Here are some code comments (world.py) to remind me of a place this came up 
(but not the only place it matters) 
(i didn't try to make these comments understandable to anyone else, so far):

##    _index_counter = State(int, 1000) # moved here from demo_drag 070202
##        ####k i think this should not be usage-tracked!!! think abt that... then see if true (probably not)

    ## _index_counter = 1000 # (an easier way to make it not tracked [070202]) ####WRONG, when self is remade!!! [070203 re-realization]

    _index_counter = property( lambda self: len(self.nodelist) + 3000 ) # 070203 experiment -- known to be wrong, see below;
        # WARNING also includes a commenting out of this date [#####e needs code cleanup]
        ###k MIGHT BE WRONG since it usage-tracks nodelist -- REVIEW ###
        ### AND SURELY WRONG once we can delete individual nodes.

        # The tracking danger is that whenever you make any new object, the old objects see that the index they used is different
        # and think they too need remaking or something like that! This needs thinking through
        # since it probably covers all make-data, not just the index. All make-data is being snapshotted.
        # For that matter, things used by "commands" are in general different than things used to recompute.
        # Maybe entire commands need to have traced usage discarded or kept in a new kind of place. #####

update 070213: see revised and cleaned-up comments in world.py, and revised implem --
which didn't fix the slowness in making new objects when lots of old ones are there.
Note that much of that slowness goes away if MT is closed; see comments in demo_MT.py about
a likely cause of that (an optim-bug in MT_try2).

==

070203 DisplayListChunk update bug: series of prefs checkbox changes (eg show central cyl,
testexpr_30g) fails to remake the displist after the first change, until certain other things
happen, not yet characterized but including highlighting the affected object.

Not yet understood; no evidence it's due to displists except that it doesn't happen if
DisplayListChunk is disabled (ie if it draws directly without using its displist). It was not
noticed except in the first- tried case of a nested displist, so maybe it relates to that. The
code it affects seems to be the DisplayListChunk in the following (in dna_ribbon_view.py.py); see
also the comments in this code excerpt.

Things to try: see if removing one or the other of the nested displists (the one shown below
or the one around the World) fixes the bug -- if it's due to nested ones, either one's removal
should fix it; if not, probably only the following one's, or only both's, removal will fix it.

    def _cmd_Make_DNA_Cylinder(self):
        expr = DNA_Cylinder()
        # Note: ideally, only that much (expr, at this point) would be stored as world's state, with the following wrappers
        # added on more dynamically as part of finding the viewer for the model objects in world. ###e
        # (Nice side effect: then code-reloading of the viewer would not require clearing and remaking the model objs.)
        expr = DisplayListChunk( expr) # displist around cylinder itself -- speeds(unverified) redraw of cyl while it's dragged, or anywhen [070203]
            ###BUG (though this being the cause is only suspected): prefs changes remake the displist only the first time in a series of them,
            # until the next time the object is highlighted or certain other things happen (exact conditions not yet clear); not yet diagnosed;
            # might relate to nested displists, since this is apparently the first time we've used them.
        expr = DraggableObject( expr)
        ## expr = DisplayListChunk( expr) # displist around drag-repositioned cyl -- prevents drag of this cyl from recompiling world's dlist
            ###BUG: seems to be messed up by highlighting/displist known bug, enough that I can't tell if it's working in other ways --
            # the printed recompile graph makes sense, but the number of recomps (re changetrack prediction as I drag more)
            # seems wrong (it only recompiles when the drag first starts, but I think every motion ought to do it),
            # but maybe the highlight/displist bug is preventing the drag events from working properly before they get that far.
            # So try it again after fixing that old issue (not simple). [070203 9pm]
        self.world.make_and_add( expr)
        return

update 070204: turning off an old optim in DisplayListChunk (comment contains "070204") fixes this bug --
but I won't resolve it fixed until I understand why the optim caused it, whether it's entirely fixed,
etc. Meanwhile the optim is off, but can be turned back on by a debug pref,
"DisplayListChunk: permit optim 070204?"; when on it prints something whenever it's used
(even if the use makes no difference); it's printed a lot of times on each redraw.

==

070204: maybe not repeatable: started up in testexpr_30g, made a cyl, used mousewheel on it
right away, got one time subs already fulfilled debug prints [the bug]; also observed (known)
highlight-posn bug; turned displists off, debug prints gone; turned them back on, can't
remember if still gone, and remade instance [not even sure in which order i did those 2 things],
and the bug (debug prints) doesn't recur. Didn't yet try repeating it in a new session.

==

070213: _index_counter = _self.untracked_model_state._index_counter fails as a state alias --
not only for set, but even for get (returns wrong non-updated value, no error message).
See details in a comment in world.py (below). But the same thing used for get exists
in Highlightable.py, for glname. I don't know why (or if) it works there. I've added debug code to
print a warning if it ever fails there.

Here is the comment (partly out of context):

    ###BUG: even for get, the abbreviated form (self._index_counter) is not updated when the spelled out form is!!
    # See this debug print from when we tried that here:
    ## print "after set to %r, self._index_counter = %r, self.untracked_model_state._index_counter = %r" % \
    ##   (index, self._index_counter, self.untracked_model_state._index_counter )
    ## # it prints: after set to 4002, self._index_counter = 4001, self.untracked_model_state._index_counter = 4002
    # This is weird, since Highlightable seems to succeed using a similar glname abbrev for get.
    # (Unless it doesn't, and I never noticed?? To check, I just added debug code for that -- so far untriggered.)
