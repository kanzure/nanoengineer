Subject: Physical units in Python

I was looking at some of the traffic on the nanorex-all list,
particularly the thread about using physical dimensions or units in
Python. I once wrote some code for this which you are welcome to use,
see attached. I think there is also something like this (probably done
better) in SciPy or NumPy or one of those things, I believe it's
something Konrad Hinsen put together.

I'm sure you've already thought of this, but for performance reasons,
you'll want some way to switch off the physical units when you're done
looking for bugs involving incorrect physical dimensions, and go back
to plain numbers.
