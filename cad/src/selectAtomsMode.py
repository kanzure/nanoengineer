History:

Some things that need cleanup in this code [bruce 060721 comment]: ####@@@@
- redundant use of glRenderMode (see comment where that is used)

- drag algorithms for various object types and modifier keys are split over lots of methods
with lots of common but not identical code. For example, a set of atoms and jigs can be dragged
in the same way, by two different pieces of code depending on whether an atom or jig in the set
was clicked on. If this was cleaned up, so that objects clicked on would answer questions about
how to drag them, and if a drag_handler object was created to handle the drag (or the object itself
can act as one, if only it is dragged and if it knows how), the code would be clearer, some bugs
would be easier to fix, and some NFRs easier to implement. [bruce 060728 -- I'm adding drag_handlers
for use by new kinds of draggable or buttonlike things (only in selectAtoms mode and subclasses),
but not changing how old dragging code works.]

- Ninad 070216 split this out of selectMode.py

# The section is organized in the following order and includes the following methods:
#
#   - LMB down-click (button press) methods
#       leftShiftDown()
#       leftCntlDown()
#       leftDown()
#
#   - LMB drag methods

# 
#   - LMB up-click (button release) methods
#       leftShiftUp()
#       leftCntlUp()
#       leftUp()
#
#   - LMB double-click method (only one)
#       leftDouble()
