nanoENGINEER-1 Packaging Instructions
-------------------------------------


WindowsXP
---------

These instructions are for packaging the Python code required by nanoENGINEER-1 for WindowsXP: 

  1) Copy cad/src code souce directory into a packaging directory (i.e. C:/packaging). 
     Make sure NE-1 works from this directory: python atom.py.

  2) Remove all files from C:/packaging/cad/src whose names start with "gpl_only", 
     since these are not legal for us to include with the Windows (non-GPL) distribution.
     These files might include any or all of: 
	
	- gpl_only.py
	- gpl_only.pyc
	- gpl_only_ok
	- gpl_only.pyo (this file may never be there)

  3) Put "setup.py" into C:/packaging.

  4) In a Command Prompt, change directory to C:/packaging and run: 

	python setup.py py2exe --includes sip --excludes OpenGL

     This should create "build" and "dist" directories under C:/packaging.

  5) Copy the "OpenGL" directory from the Python home directory 
     (i.e. C:/python23/Lib/site-packages) to the C:/packages/dist directory.

  6) Change library.zip to library1.zip, create a directory called libary.zip, 
     unzip all the files in library1.zip into directory library.zip.

  7) Copy the "OpenGL" directory into library.zip directory too.

  8) Delete unnecessary files in "dist" and "dist/libary.zip", including:

	- OpenGL extensions
	- py files
	- tcl/tk modules

  9) Copy ImageFile.pyc, JpegImagePlugin.pyc into "dist/libary.zip".

  10) Copy the following DLL files into C:/packages/dist:

	- glut32.dll
	- msvcr71.dll


These instructions are for packaging nanoENGINEER-1 for WindowsXP:

  1) Create a directory to build installation packages (i.e. C:/distribution)

  2) Create the directory C:/distribution/program and copy everything from C:/packaging/dist into it.

  3) Create the directory called C:/distribution/bin and copy the following files into it:

	- assistant.exe (from QTDIR/bin)
	- simulator.exe (from sim/src)

  4) Copy "images" and "doc" from the cad directory into C:/distribution.

  5) Modify "setup.iss" to customize the software installation.  
     Compile it to build "setup.exe" in a directory called "output".


MacOS
-----

These instructions are for packaging the Python code required by nanoENGINEER-1 for MacOS: 

  1) Copy cad/src code souce directory into a packaging directory (i.e. C:/packaging). 
     Make sure NE-1 works from this directory: python atom.py.

  2) Put "setup.py" into C:/packaging.

  3) In a Command Prompt, change directory to C:/packaging and run: 

	python setup.py py2app --includes sip --packages OpenGL

     This should create "build" and "dist" directories under C:/packaging.

  4) Delete unnecessary files in "dist" and "dist/libary.zip", including:

	- OpenGL extensions
	- py files
	- tcl/tk modules


These instructions are for packaging nanoENGINEER-1 for MacOS:

   1) Refer the instructions of packageMaker to build *.pkg file and optionally put the *.pkg into disk image file *.dmg.
